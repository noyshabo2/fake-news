## Current Work Focus
- **Project Setup Complete**: All major structural issues resolved
- **Memory Bank Creation**: Documenting project for future sessions

## Next Steps (Priority Order)
1. **Test the Application**: Run `npm run dev` to verify everything works
2. **Fix Any Remaining Issues**: Address any runtime errors or styling problems
3. **Optimize Performance**: Review loading times and optimization opportunities
4. **Content Enhancement**: Add more articles or improve existing content
5. **SEO Improvements**: Add proper meta tags and structured data

## Active Decisions & Considerations

- **Routing Approach**: Using App Router dynamic routes for scalable article system
- **Component Structure**: Keeping existing article components while migrating to new structure
- **Content Strategy**: Started with sample articles, ready for real content integration

## Issues to Monitor
- **Font Loading**: Ensure Heebo font loads properly for Hebrew text
- **RTL Layout**: Verify all components work correctly with right-to-left layout
- **Image Paths**: Confirm all image assets load from `/public/assets/`
- **Mobile Responsive**: Test responsive design on various screen sizes

## Technical Debt
- **Routes Migration**: Old components in `/routes/` should eventually be refactored
- **Static Data**: Article data is currently hardcoded, may need CMS integration
- **Error Handling**: Add proper error boundaries and 404 pages
- **Accessibility**: Audit and improve accessibility features
